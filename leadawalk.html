    <h1>Lead a Walk</h1>

    <h2>We are no longer accepting new walk submissions, thank you for your interest in Jane's Walk Saskatoon.</h2>


    <p>
        Jane’s Walks can be led by anyone who wants to share with others what they believe makes their new or old
        neighborhood, or Saskatoon, a special place to live. Your walk and conversation should be approximately one
        hour in length and can be about music, art, nature, diversity, religion, history…any thread in the fabric of
        life in our great city.
    </p>

    <p>
        When choosing a time to start your walk, take a look on this website (see the Join a Walk page) at other
        walks that are posted and, if at all possible, pick a time other than that for which walks are already
        scheduled on your preferred day.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please aim to have your walk posted here by April 20. We will accept walks until the end of April, but it is
        ideal to have a month’s lead time for us, and you, to get out word about your walk.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will advertise your walk on this website and on posters, etc. We will also create an event for each walk
        on our Facebook page. Past experience tells us that it is very helpful for you to share your walk
        information with your network of family, friends, and colleagues, too.
    </p>

    <p>
        The walks proceed rain or shine.
    </p>

    <p>
        Want to lead a walk? Follow these 3 easy steps:
    </p>

    <p>
        1. Fill in and submit the form below and your walk will appear on the Join a Walk page of this website within 24
        hours.
    </p>

    <p>
        2. Give some thought to what you want to say and where you will lead the walkers.
    </p>

    <p>
        3. Arrive 15 minutes before the start of your walk. Someone from the Jane’s Walk Committee will join you to
        assist in greeting people.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here are examples of walks held in previous years:
    </p>

    <p>
        Earliest Saskatoon: A walk through the streets and lanes of the original 1883 town of Saskatoon to give a
        hint of life in those early years.
    </p>

    <p>
        Guided tour of graffiti and street art: A back-alley tour of unexpected art work.
    </p>

    <p>
        33rd Street West – Small town main street: A walk along 33rd street near Idylwyld Avenue showed that the
        character of the original ‘main street’ is still a gathering place for people.
    </p>

    <p>
        Urban water issues and gardening: This walk started at the Riversdale/King George Community Garden and
        discussed how to garden using less water, urban water issues, and how to keep our river clean.
