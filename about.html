    <h1>About</h1>


    <p>Jane’s Walk is a movement of free, volunteer-led walking conversations inspired by Jane Jacobs. It encourages
        people to share stories about their neighbourhoods, discover unseen aspects of their communities, and use
        walking as a way to connect with their neighbours.</p>

    <p>Jane Jacobs (1916-2006) was a writer, urbanist and activist who championed the voices of everyday people in
        neighbourhood planning and city-building. The annual Jane’s Walk takes place the first weekend in May (close
        to
        Jane Jacobs’ birthday on May 4th).</p>

    <p>Her first book, The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961), challenged the ideas of modernist city
        planning and offered a new vision of diverse cities made for and by the people who live in them. </p>

    <p>Jane’s Walk was founded in 2006 as a living, walking commemoration of Jane and her legacy. Ten years later,
        in
        2016, over 1,000 Jane’s Walks took place in 212 cities around the world, spanning 36 countries and 6
        continents. </p>

    <p>No one can find what will work for our cities by looking at … suburban garden cities, manipulating scale
        models,
        or inventing dream cities. You’ve got to get out and walk.

        – Jane Jacobs.</p>

    <p>Jane’s Walk in Saskatoon is coordinated by a small volunteer planning committee. In 2019, we incorporated as
        a
        non-profit organization called Jane’s Walk Festival Saskatoon Inc. We provide this website for anyone who
        wants
        to lead a walk, or join one or more walks being offered
        <u2>free of charge.</u2>
    </p>

    <p>Committee members also respond to email inquiries, promote the walks to encourage participation, and act as
        co-hosts with walk leaders.</p>

    <p>We look forward to seeing you at a walk in 2025!</p>
